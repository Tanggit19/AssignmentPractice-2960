Task-1:

a.  By considering the scenario mentioned in the question, the app should be worked on 
    both in ios and android device. Since already there is an existing website as well, I 
    choose PWA (progressive web app) framework for John’s project.
    
    
b.  Native apps and Hybrid Apps. 
    1. Native:  Native apps, also known as platform-specific or device-specific, are built 
                using the programming language that a platform provides (Objective-C for iOS and 
                Java for Android). If you want to have your app in both Android and iOS, you would 
                have to build your app in two separate programming languages.
    2.  Hybrid: Hybrid apps are coded with web-based technologies, like HTML, CSS, and 
                JavaScript. The resulting app can usually be found on Apple App Store or Google Play 
                Store by searching for the name or URL of the website it’s based on. What makes 
                them “hybrid” is that they use web views to present their content — think of them as 
                mini-browser windows inside your mobile application.
                
                
c.  Since it is mentioned in the question as John Doe needs to build an app for an existing 
    website and run it on both iOS and Android devices, this app should be a mix of Native 
    and Hybrid apps. Since the John can invest a lot as well in this, I chose PWA as the 
    suitable framework.
    
    
d.  Online bidding feature for buying the music which will help to improve the demand for 
    his products.
    
    
e.  Spotify / SoundCloud / HDtracks / Amazon Music: 
    There are lots of online marketplaces such as the mentioned examples for the same 
    purpose but not virtual store fronts as much like John’s project
